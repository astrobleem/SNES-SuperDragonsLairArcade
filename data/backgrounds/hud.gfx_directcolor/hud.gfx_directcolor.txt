Background: HUD Overlay (Direct Color Mode)
Target output filename: hud_xcf.png
Resolution: 256x224 SNES background, 8bpp direct color mode (mode 3/4); allows full 256 colors but no palette effects.
Prompt: "Dragon's Lair HUD overlay elements, ornate medieval border frame with dragon corner decorations, transparent center for gameplay video, decorative panels for lives/score/time indicators, golden filigree details, 16-bit SNES pixel art, rich colors, 256x224." 
Alignment notes: Keep the central gameplay area completely transparent or solid black (for masking); place all decorative elements along the edges. This uses direct color mode for richer HUD details without palette limitations.
Technical notes: Direct color mode (8bpp) bypasses palette system for full RGB, used for static overlays that won't need palette effects.
