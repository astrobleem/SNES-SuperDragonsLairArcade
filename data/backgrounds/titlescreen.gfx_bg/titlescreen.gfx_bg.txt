Background: Title Screen

Asset Format: PNG image (NOT transparent - solid background)
Required Size: 256x224 pixels
Color Depth: 4bpp with up to 8 palettes (16 colors each, keep totals under 128 colors)

Target output filename: titlescreen.gfx_bg.png
Technical: SNES background using 8x8 tiles. Favor broad, flat color regions to avoid tile breakup.
Prompt: "Dragon's Lair arcade title screen, Dirk the Daring silhouette with raised sword in front of a stone castle gate, bold 'Dragon's Lair' logotype in glowing gold and cyan, dramatic torchlight, dark vignette edges, crisp 16-bit SNES style, limited color bands, no gradients, 256x224." 
Alignment notes: Keep the logo horizontally centered; leave safe margins around edges for HUD overlays and palette cycling. Avoid fine text that would muddy after 4bpp quantization.
