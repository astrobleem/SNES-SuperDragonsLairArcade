So... you're not gonna believe this.

My dad works at Nintendo. Yeah, seriously. He's a Senior Test Engineer in the "Special Projects" division. He usually doesn't bring work home, but last night he left his briefcase unlocked in the den.

I took a peek.

Inside was **THIS**. It's a prototype for an arcade-perfect port of *Dragon's Lair* for the Super Nintendo. I know, I know, everyone says the SNES can't handle LaserDisc games. That's what I thought too. But look at this stuff! It uses some new "MSU-1" chip or something? I don't know, but it looks UNREAL.

I managed to snap some photos before he woke up. Check this out before he finds out and grounds me for life.

## The "Care Package"

![The Stash](complete_package.png)

The box didn't just have the game. It was full of this premium schwag. They must be planning a huge launch for this.

## The Hardware

![System and Game](system_and_game.png)

The cart is heavier than normal. You can feel the power of that extra chip inside. The label art is sick—way better than the box art for the other versions.

---

## The Loot

They included all this bonus stuff for the "Early Reviewers" (aka me, right now).

### Holographic Dirk Card

![Holographic Card](holographic_card.png)

This thing is shiny as heck. It's got that thick, premium 90s foil feel. Dirk looks like he's about to jump out of the card.

### Sticker Sheet

![Stickers](sticker_sheet.png)

I'm definitely putting that "Dirk" sticker on my skateboard. Don't tell my dad.

### Cinema Poster

![Poster](poster.png)

Full-size movie poster. It looks like something you'd see in a theater lobby, not a game store.

## The "Official" Docs

### Instruction Manual

![Manual](user_manual_cover.png)

It's not just a booklet; it's a survival guide.
*Read the full text [here](usermanual.txt) if you want to survive past the first room.*

### Warranty Card

![Warranty](warranty_card.png)

"Mail to Redmond, WA." Yeah, right. Like I'm sending this back.

### Upcoming Releases

![Hype](upcoming_releases.png)

There's a flyer in here teasing more arcade ports. *Space Ace* on SNES? *Thayer's Quest*? If this tech is real, the 16-bit wars are OVER. Sega is cooked.

## The Soundtrack

![CD](soundtrack_cd.png)

It came with a CD! "Original Arcade Soundtrack - Remastered." I popped it in my Discman. It's crystal clear. None of that muffled 16-bit synth stuff. Real instruments.
