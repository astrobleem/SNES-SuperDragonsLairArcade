# Repository Agent Guide

Welcome! This guide applies to the entire repository and is meant to save you time when working here.

## Python toolchain pitfalls
- The helper scripts in `tools/` are now **Python 3 compatible**. All tools have been modernized and tested. Use `python` or `python3` to run them. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Several scripts (e.g., `tools/animationWriter.py`, `tools/xmlsceneparser.py`) previously had `TabError` issues from mixed tabs/spaces; these have been normalized. Run `python -m tabnanny <script>` if you encounter indentation issues.
- When adjusting the tools, avoid adding silent try/except wrappers around imports; fix the root cause instead so failures remain visible.

## Build expectations
- Follow the original README's guidance: builds target Linux, WLA DX 9.5a, and other SNES-specific utilities. The MSU audio/video assets are not generated by default.

## Documentation and commits
- Keep notes about any non-obvious setup steps you encounter while running tools so future updates to this guide stay accurate.
- Write clear commit messages that describe the change scope (e.g., "Add repo-wide agent guidance for Python tools").

## Agent Log
- **Antigravity** (2025-11-22): Validated `tools/chapter_event_inventory.py` and confirmed 100% event coverage. The project is ready for full implementation of mapped events. Validated that `README.md` is up to date with these findings.
- **Antigravity** (2025-11-22): Completed Python 3 migration for all tools scripts. Fixed compatibility issues in `mod2snes.py` (bytes/strings, integer division), `gracon.py` (chr() → bytes()), and `xmlsceneparser.py` (integer division). Created comprehensive test for `mod2snes.py`. All tools are now Python 3 compatible and tested.
