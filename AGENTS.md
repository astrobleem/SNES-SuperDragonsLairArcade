# Repository Agent Guide

Welcome! This guide applies to the entire repository and is meant to save you time when working here.

## Python toolchain pitfalls
- The helper scripts in `tools/` were written for **Python 2.7** (see `README`). The default `python` on this environment is Python 3.12, so prefer calling `python2` if available or explicitly testing compatibility changes under Python 3.
- Several scripts (e.g., `tools/animationWriter.py`, `tools/xmlsceneparser.py`) currently raise `TabError` immediately because their indentation mixes tabs and spaces. Before running or editing these tools, normalize indentation to spaces and run `python -m tabnanny <script>` to catch lingering issues.
- When adjusting the tools, avoid adding silent try/except wrappers around imports; fix the root cause instead so failures remain visible.

## Build expectations
- Follow the original README’s guidance: builds target Linux, WLA DX 9.5a, and other SNES-specific utilities. The MSU audio/video assets are not generated by default.

## Documentation and commits
- Keep notes about any non-obvious setup steps you encounter while running tools so future updates to this guide stay accurate.
- Write clear commit messages that describe the change scope (e.g., "Add repo-wide agent guidance for Python tools").
